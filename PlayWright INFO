So just started learning about the playwright
I am using the yarn to install the required pakages of playwright and it is because of I think yarn is more fast
than the npm pakage so the commnad I have used

first we have to install the yarn and then install the playwright with help of it. so

command to install yarn is
npm install --global yarn

command to install playwright with yarn
yarn create playwright

it is install
it have a project structure like below

- folder structure
-github\workflows
this folder is basically from github actions
-tests
Whatever the test created are goes inside this folder
-testexample
it is basically from the github for test purpose
-playwright config
is where you can add configuration for Playwright

other files are not important for now

I have devloped my own project  for goal management system and try to pass my name ,email,
password through the test case

wright down my first test to send the post request and the api
http://localhost:8000/api/users/register


I am facing the issue to post the request on the route 
api testing is done 

How to pass the data from one script to another script ?
How to run the api test in headed mode?
